#Defer That Command!

This project is designed to prototype a solution for building a CQRS driven service with commands that are executed both synchronously and asynchronously, and across a variety of worker services.

It utilizes a few well known projects to help bootstrap itself, stiches together things with the help of [.Net Junkie's](https://www.cuttingedge.it/blogs/steven/index.php) suggestions and a bit of my own tweaking.

I'd love your input, so feel free to drop a line over at [nerdamigo.com](https://nerdamigo.com)
